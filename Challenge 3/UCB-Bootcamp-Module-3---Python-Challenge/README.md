Challenge 3 - Python
For challenge 3 I created a Python script to analyze two different data sets. The first being about budget and financial records. Through this CSV, I analyzed the records to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of 'profit/losses' over the entire period, the changes in profit/loss, as well as the the greatest increase/decrease in profits over a portion of time. The second dataset covered election data and results. I created a script that analyzed and calculated the total votes cast, complete list of votes received by each candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election.
